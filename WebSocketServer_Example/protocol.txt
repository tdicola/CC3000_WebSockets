Format:
Opcode		1 byte			Operation ID
Length		1 byte			Amount of bytes in the payload.
Payload		n bytes (up to 255)	Payload for the associated opcode.

What byte ordering?  Network byte order?

Opcodes:

0x00 	- unused

0x01	- read digital pin question
	  payload is 1 byte: the pin to be read

0x02	- read digital pin state answer
	  payload is 2 bytes: one for the pin and the second for the state (1 = high, 0 = low)

0x03	- read analog pin question
	  payload is 1 byte: the pin to read

0x04	- read analog pin state answer
	  payload is 3 bytes: one for the pin and the second two for the uint16_t value of the
	  ADC (0 to 1023)

0x05	- write digital pin
	  payload is 2 bytes: one for the pin and the second for the new state (1 = high, 0 = low)

0x06	- write neopixel state
	  payload is 25*3 bytes: one triple of R, G, B values for each 25 pixels in order
